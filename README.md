## Introduction

Air pollution has a significant impact on the environment. Monitoring and predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) helps us assess the quality of air and take precautionary measures to minimize exposure to pollutants.

# **Problem Statement**
Information on air quality is frequently very unclear, which makes it challenging for peoples to respond to pollution flows. Data on air quality is accessible, but it typically absences the specifics required to identify patterns as take preventative action. That is the issue what we seek to resolve by our project. By developing a model that forecasts the quality of the air in Karachi. The system's precise daily projections can aid people, and the officials in better understanding pollution patterns and implementing effective responses.
